# Data Leakage and Security in cloud
   This web application is used to detect and prevent leakage in the cloud using the SHA-2 algorithm. The sender sends the file to the receiver using this application, and the receiver cannot download the file without the secret key. The receiver requests the key from the sender. The sender will decide whether he will provide the key or not. In case the receiver tries to download the file using a random key, only two attempts will be provided. In case the receiver fails that attempt, he will automatically log out and be blocked by the admin. Only admins will unblock the user.
